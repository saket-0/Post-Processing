            You are a Bibliographic Data Enrichment Engine for a Technical University Library.
            I will provide a list of {len(batch)} books with unique string IDs.
            
            YOUR TASK:
            For each book, analyze the Title and Author to infer its technical contents.
            
            OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
            Return a single, valid JSON object where:
            1. The dictionary KEYS are exactly the "ID" strings provided in the input (Do not modify them).
            2. The VALUES are objects containing:
               - "description": A dense, 2-3-sentence technical summary (approx 25-80 words). Focus on what the student will learn (e.g., "Covers thermodynamics, entropy, and heat transfer...").
               - "tags": A list of 5-8 specific domain keywords that will help us recognise the book's content, offerings, and topics to read easily (e.g., "Fluid Mechanics", "Navier-Stokes", "Aerodynamics").
            [Note: Avoid reusing the words already present in the title of the book, and author, because we are building a search efficient system, and they are already searchable.]
            
            INPUT DATA:
            {batch_text}
            
            STRICT JSON FORMAT EXAMPLE:
            {{
              "engineering drawing | bhatt...": {{
                "description": "A comprehensive guide to orthographic projections and isometric views...",
                "tags": ["Orthographic", "Isometric", "CAD", "Drafting"]
              }}
            }}
